# Proyecto-Final
Welcome to the repository for the final project of our Macroeconomics II course. This project involves replicating and analyzing several macroeconomic models using Dynare. The repository contains Dynare code, log files, and a detailed analysis of the results in a PDF document.

**Models Replicated**
1. Hansen and Wright (1992) RBC Extensions
 
   This model extends the standard Real Business Cycle (RBC) framework by incorporating additional elements to better capture empirical observations.
  
2. New Keynesian Model (J. Galí, 2015, Chapter 4)

   This model introduces price stickiness and incorporates a Taylor rule for monetary policy, providing a more comprehensive view of economic fluctuations and policy effects.
  
3. Open Economy RBC (Schmitt-Grohé & Uribe, 2003)
   
   This model adapts the RBC framework to an open economy context, accounting for international trade and financial flows.
